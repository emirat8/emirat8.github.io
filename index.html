          Chelsea Football Club are an English professional football club based in Fulham, London. Founded in 1905, they
          compete in the Premier League, the top division of English football.

          <p>
            In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium with the aim of turning it into a football
            ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use
            the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of
            Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also
            considered. Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite
            the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly
            afterwards.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chelsea won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second
            Divisions in their early years. They reached the 1915 FA Cup Final, where they lost to Sheffield United at
            Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that
            point. Chelsea had a reputation for signing star players and attracted large crowds; they had the highest
            average attendances in English football in ten separate seasons including 1907–08, 1909–10, 1911–12,
            1912–13, 1913–14 and 1919–20. They were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1920 and 1932 and remained in the First
            Division throughout the 1930s, but success eluded the club in the inter-war years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Former Arsenal and England centre-forward Ted Drake was appointed manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise
            the club. He removed the club's Chelsea pensioner crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime,
            rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their
            first major trophy success – the League championship – in 1954–55. The following season saw UEFA create the
            European Champions' Cup, but after objections from The Football League and the FA, Chelsea were persuaded to
            withdraw from the competition before it started. Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the
            remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach Tommy
            Docherty.
          </p>

          <p>
            Docherty built a new team around the group of talented young players emerging from the club's youth set-up
            and Chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course
            for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into the final stages of the 1964–65 season, winning the
            League Cup but faltering late on in the other two. In three seasons the side were beaten in three major
            semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Docherty's successor, Dave Sexton, Chelsea won the FA Cup in
            1970, beating Leeds United 2–1 in a final replay. The following year, Chelsea took their first European
            honour, a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup triumph, with another replayed win, this time over Real Madrid in Athens.
          </p>

          <p>
            The late 1970s through to the '80s was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of
            Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club, star players were sold and the team were
            relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious hooligan element among the support, which was to
            plague the club throughout the decade. In 1982, Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by
            Ken Bates for the nominal sum of £1, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property
            developers, meaning the club faced losing their home. On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming
            close to relegation to the Third Division for the first time, but in 1983 manager John Neal put together an
            impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the Second Division title in 1983–84 and established
            themselves in the top division with two top-six finishes, before being relegated again in 1988. The club
            bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal
            with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash. Chelsea's form in the
            new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the 1994 FA Cup Final. The appointment of Ruud
            Gullit as player-manager in 1996 began an upturn in the team's fortunes. He added several top international
            players to the side and led the club to their first major honour since 1971, the FA Cup. Gullit was replaced
            by Gianluca Vialli, whose reign saw Chelsea win the League Cup, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super
            Cup in 1998, and the FA Cup in 2000. They also mounted a strong title challenge in 1998–99, finishing four
            points behind champions Manchester United, and made their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League.
            Vialli was sacked in favour of Claudio Ranieri, who guided Chelsea to the 2002 FA Cup Final and Champions
            League qualification in 2002–03.
          </p>

          <p>
            In July 2003, Bates sold Chelsea to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for £140 million. Over £100 million
            was spent on new players, but Ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies, and was replaced by José Mourinho.
            Under Mourinho, Chelsea became the fifth English team to win back-to-back league championships since the
            Second World War (2004–05 and 2005–06), in addition to winning an FA Cup (2007) and two League Cups (2005
            and 2007). After a poor start to the 2007–2008 season, Mourinho was replaced by Avram Grant, who led the
            club to their first UEFA Champions League final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester United.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2009, under caretaker manager Guus Hiddink, Chelsea won another FA Cup. In 2009–10, his successor Carlo
            Ancelotti led them to their first Premier League and FA Cup Double, also becoming the first English
            top-flight club to score 100 league goals in a season since 1963. In 2012, Roberto Di Matteo led Chelsea to
            their seventh FA Cup, and their first UEFA Champions League title, beating Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties,
            the first London club to win the trophy. The following year the club won the UEFA Europa League, making them
            the first club to hold two major European titles simultaneously and one of five clubs to have won the three
            main UEFA trophies. Mourinho returned as manager in 2013 and led Chelsea to League Cup success in March
            2015, and the Premier League title two months later. Mourinho was sacked after four months of the following
            season after a poor start. In 2017, under new coach Antonio Conte, Chelsea won their sixth English title and
            the following season won their eighth FA Cup. In 2018 Conte was sacked after a 5th-place finish and replaced
            with Maurizio Sarri, under whom Chelsea reached the League Cup final, which they lost on penalties to
            Manchester City and won the Europa League for a second time, beating Arsenal 4–1 in the final. Sarri then
            left the club to become manager of Juventus and was then replaced by former Chelsea player Frank Lampard.

            Chelsea have always worn blue shirts, although they originally used the paler eton blue, which was taken
            from the racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, and was worn with white shorts and dark blue
            or black socks. The light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912. In the 1960s
            Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever
            since) and white socks, believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other
            major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season. Since then Chelsea have
            always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were
            reintroduced.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chelsea's away colours are usually all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club have had
            a number of black or dark blue away kits which alternate every year. As with most teams, they have also had
            some more unusual ones. At Docherty's behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue and black
            stripes, based on Inter Milan's kit. In the mid-1970s, the away strip was a red, white and green kit
            inspired by the Hungarian national side of the 1950s. Other memorable away kits include an all jade strip
            worn from 1986–89, red and white diamonds from 1990–92, graphite and tangerine from 1994–96, and luminous
            yellow from 2007–08. The graphite and tangerine strip has appeared in lists of the worst football kits ever.

            In 1930, Chelsea featured in one of the earliest football films, The Great Game. One-time Chelsea centre
            forward, Jack Cock, who by then was playing for Millwall, was the star of the film and several scenes were
            shot at Stamford Bridge, including on the pitch, the boardroom, and the dressing rooms. It included guest
            appearances by then-Chelsea players Andrew Wilson, George Mills, and Sam Millington. Owing to the notoriety
            of the Chelsea Headhunters, a football firm associated with the club, Chelsea have also featured in films
            about football hooliganism, including 2004's The Football Factory. Chelsea also appear in the Hindi film
            Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. In April 2011, Montenegrin comedy series Nijesmo mi od juče made an episode in which
            Chelsea play against FK Sutjeska Nikšić for qualification of the UEFA Champions League.

            Up until the 1950s, the club had a long-running association with the music halls; their underachievement
            often provided material for comedians such as George Robey. It culminated in comedian Norman Long's release
            of a comic song in 1933, ironically titled "On the Day That Chelsea Went and Won the Cup", the lyrics of
            which describe a series of bizarre and improbable occurrences on the hypothetical day when Chelsea finally
            won a trophy. In Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film The 39 Steps, Mr Memory claims that Chelsea last won the Cup
            in 63 BC, "in the presence of the Emperor Nero." Scenes in a 1980 episode of Minder were filmed during a
            real match at Stamford Bridge between Chelsea and Preston North End with Terry McCann (played by Dennis
            Waterman) standing on the terraces.

              The song "Blue is the Colour" was released as a single in the build-up to the 1972 League Cup Final, with
              all members of Chelsea's first team squad singing; it reached number five in the UK Singles Chart. The
              song has since been adopted as an anthem by a number of other sports teams around the world, including the
              Vancouver Whitecaps (as "White is the Colour") and the Saskatchewan Roughriders (as "Green is the
              Colour"). In the build-up to the 1997 FA Cup Final, the song "Blue Day", performed by Suggs and members of
              the Chelsea squad, reached number 22 in the UK charts.
